# Impact Echo

The IE method is a seismic or stress-wave based method used to detect defects in concrete, primarily delamination. The objective of the IE survey is to detect and characterize wave reflectors or “resonators” in a concrete bridge deck or other structural elements.

## Installation

Inorder to run all of the algorithms developed for Impact Echo, [`ie-env`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/tree/main/impact-echo/environment) environment is required.

We strongly recomend installing  [`ie-env`] in anaconda.


## Peak Frequency Mapping

A form of Conventional IE data analysis in which we create peak frequency maps, the frequency corresponding to the maximum peak amplitude in each IE frequency spectrum is mapped on to the location of IE test point on the specimen.
