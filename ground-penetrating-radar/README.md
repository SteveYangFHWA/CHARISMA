# Ground Penetrating Radar GPR

Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a rapid, nondestructive testing method that can be used to identify and map areas with a high likelihood of corrosion-based deterioration, assess construction quality, determine structural reinforcement layout, and estimate thickness of the deck, overlays, or reinforcement cover.

Additional information about GPR can be found [`here`](https://infotechnology.fhwa.dot.gov/wp-content/themes/nde/inc/mpdf-development/Generatedpdfs/GPRDelaminationandCorrosion.pdf)


## Installation

Inorder to run all of the algorithms developed for Ground Penetrating Radar, [`charisma-env`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/blob/main/environment) environment is required.

We strongly recommend installing  [`charisma-env`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/blob/main/environment) via conda.
